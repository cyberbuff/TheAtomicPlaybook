Welcome to the Atomic Playbook
============================

The Atomic Playbook contains TTPs from the MITRE ATT&CK framework mapped to the tests in the Atomic Red Team. It serves as a single resource to know about the tests, it's execution, detection and defense techniques from [MITRE Shield](shield.mitre.org).

Note: Shield mapping to subtechniques is yet to be done.
