    "# T1480 - Execution Guardrails",
    "\n",
    "Adversaries may use execution guardrails to constrain execution or actions based on adversary supplied and environment specific conditions that are expected to be present on the target. Guardrails ensure that a payload only executes against an intended target and reduces collateral damage from an adversary\u2019s campaign.(Citation: FireEye Kevin Mandia Guardrails) Values an adversary can provide about a target system or environment to use as guardrails may include specific network share names, attached physical devices, files, joined Active Directory (AD) domains, and local/external IP addresses.(Citation: FireEye Outlook Dec 2019)\n\nGuardrails can be used to prevent exposure of capabilities in environments that are not intended to be compromised or operated within. This use of guardrails is distinct from typical [Virtualization/Sandbox Evasion](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1497). While use of [Virtualization/Sandbox Evasion](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1497) may involve checking for known sandbox values and continuing with execution only if there is no match, the use of guardrails will involve checking for an expected target-specific value and only continuing with execution if there is such a match."

    "\n",
    "Detecting the use of guardrails may be difficult depending on the implementation. Monitoring for suspicious processes being spawned that gather a variety of system information or perform other forms of [Discovery](https://attack.mitre.org/tactics/TA0007), especially in a short period of time, may aid in detection."

    "# Shield Active Defense\n## Behavioral Analytics \n Deploy tools that detect unusual system or user behavior. \n\n Instrument a system to collect detailed information about process execution and user activity, develop a sense of normal or expected behaviors, and alert on abnormal or unexpected activity.  This can be accomplished either onboard the target system or by shipping data to a centralized analysis and alerting system.\n### Opportunity\nThere is an opportunity to detect the presence of an adversary by identifying and alerting on anomalous behaviors.\n### Use Case\nA defender could develop behavioral analytics to detect the examination of commonly used guardrails such as inspection of VM artifacts, enumeration of connected storage and/or devices, domain information, etc.\n### Procedures\nUse behavioral analytics to detect Living Off The Land Binaries (LOLBins) being used to download and execute a file.\nUse behavioral analytics to identify a system running development tools, but is not used by someone who does development.\nUse behavioral analytics to identify abnormal system processes being used to launch a different process."
