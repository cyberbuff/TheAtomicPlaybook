Several Microsoft signed scripts that have been downloaded from Microsoft or are default on Windows installations can be used to proxy execution of other files.(Citation: LOLBAS Project) This behavior may be abused by adversaries to execute malicious files that could bypass application control and signature validation on systems.(Citation: GitHub Ultimate AppLocker Bypass List)"

This can be accomplished either onboard the target system or by shipping data to a centralized analysis and alerting system.\n#### Opportunity\nThere is an opportunity to detect the presence of an adversary by identifying and alerting on anomalous behaviors.\n#### Use Case\nA defender can look for anomalies in how commands are being executed on a system. This can expose potentially malicious activity.\n#### Procedures\nUse behavioral analytics to detect Living Off The Land Binaries (LOLBins) being used to download and execute a file.\nUse behavioral analytics to identify a system running development tools, but is not used by someone who does development.\nUse behavioral analytics to identify abnormal system processes being used to launch a different process.\n"
