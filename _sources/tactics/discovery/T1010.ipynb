    "System and network discovery techniques normally occur throughout an operation as an adversary learns the environment. Data and events should not be viewed in isolation, but as part of a chain of behavior that could lead to other activities based on the information obtained.\n\nMonitor processes and command-line arguments for actions that could be taken to gather system and network information. Remote access tools with built-in features may interact directly with the Windows API to gather information. Information may also be acquired through Windows system management tools such as [Windows Management Instrumentation](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1047) and [PowerShell](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1059/001)."

On a single target system, defenders can configure multiple different services or user software applications.  On a target network, defenders can present systems with a variety of operating systems, operating system versions, applications, and services.\n#### Opportunity\nThere is an opportunity to provide a variety of applications to an adversary so they see a full set of information when performing discovery tasks.\n#### Use Case\nDuring an adversary engagement operation, a defender can open and use any particular subset of applications installed on a system to control what is presented to the adversary at any point in time.\n#### Procedures\nUse a mix of vulnerable and nonvulnerable software on a system to allow you to see what exploits the adversary leverages in their attacks.\nInstall Anti-virus or other end-point detection tools on systems to see if an adversary takes note of them and if so, how they react."
