    "System and network discovery techniques normally occur throughout an operation as an adversary learns the environment. Data and events should not be viewed in isolation, but as part of a chain of behavior that could lead to other activities, such as Lateral Movement, based on the information obtained.\n\nMonitor processes and command-line arguments for actions that could be taken to gather system and network information. Remote access tools with built-in features may interact directly with the Windows API to gather information. Information may also be acquired through Windows system management tools such as [Windows Management Instrumentation](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1047) and [PowerShell](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1059/001)."

    "## Shield Active Defense\n### Software Manipulation \n Make changes to a system's software properties and functions to achieve a desired effect. \n\n Software Manipulation allows a defender to alter or replace elements of the operating system, file system, or any other software installed and executed on a system.\n#### Opportunity\nThere is an opportunity for the defender to observe the adversary and control what they can see, what effects they can have, and/or what data they can access.\n#### Use Case\nA defender could alter the output from account enumeration commands to hide accounts or show the presence of accounts which do not exist.\n#### Procedures\nHook the Win32 Sleep() function so that it always performs a Sleep(1) instead of the intended duration. This can increase the speed at which dynamic analysis can be performed when a normal malicious file sleeps for long periods before attempting additional capabilities.\nHook the Win32 NetUserChangePassword() and modify it such that the new password is different from the one provided. The data passed into the function is encrypted along with the modified new password, then logged so a defender can get alerted about the change as well as decrypt the new password for use.\nAlter the output of an adversary's profiling commands to make newly-built systems look like the operating system was installed months earlier.\nAlter the output of adversary recon commands to not show important assets, such as a file server containing sensitive data."
