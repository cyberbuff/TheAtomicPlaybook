Data and events should not be viewed in isolation, but as part of a chain of behavior that could lead to other activities based on the information obtained.\n\nMonitor processes and command-line arguments for actions that could be taken to gather system and network information. Remote access tools with built-in features may interact directly with the Windows API to gather information. Information may also be acquired through Windows system management tools such as [Windows Management Instrumentation](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1047) and [PowerShell](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1059/001)."

A defender can choose to allow or deny certain types of peripherals from being used on systems. Defenders can also introduce certain peripherals to an adversary-controlled system to see how the adversary reacts.\n#### Opportunity\nThere is an opportunity to gauge an adversary's interest in connected peripheral devices.\n#### Use Case\nA defender can connect one or more peripheral devices to a decoy system to see if an adversary has any interest in them.\n#### Procedures\nIntroduce external devices (e.g. a USB drive) to a machine in an adversary engagement scenario to see how quickly an adversary gains awareness to its presence and if they attempt to leverage the device.\nConfigure controls (such as AutoRun) which would require an adversary to take additional steps when leveraging a peripheral device to execute their tools.\n"
