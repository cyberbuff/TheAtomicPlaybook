Data and events should not be viewed in isolation, but as part of a chain of behavior that could lead to other activities, such as Lateral Movement, based on the information obtained.\n\nMonitor processes and command-line arguments for actions that could be taken to gather system information related to services. Remote access tools with built-in features may interact directly with the Windows API to gather information. Information may also be acquired through Windows system management tools such as [Windows Management Instrumentation](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1047) and [PowerShell](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1059/001)."

When a defender captures this information, the intelligence gathered can be analyzed to gain insight into the activity of an adversary at a level deeper than normal system activity monitoring.\n#### Opportunity\nThere is an opportunity for the defender to observe the adversary and control what they can see, what effects they can have, and/or what data they can access.\n#### Use Case\nA defender can monitor and analyze operating system functions calls for detection and alerting.\n#### Procedures\nTrace activity through WinSock TCP API functions to view potentially  malicious network events. Log it such that it can be pushed to a centralized location and analyzed further.\nHook the Win32 DeleteFile() function to log all attempts at deleting a given file. This information can be used to trigger restoration attempts on critical data, reducing potential disruption if those files are unavailable for prolonged periods of time.\n"
