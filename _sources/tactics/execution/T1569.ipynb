Many services are set to run at boot, which can aid in achieving persistence ([Create or Modify System Process](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1543)), but adversaries can also abuse services for one-time or temporary execution."

    "# Shield Active Defense\n## API Monitoring \n Monitor local APIs that might be used by adversary tools and activity. \n\n API Monitoring involves capturing an internal Operating System (OS) function for its usage, accompanying arguments, and result. When a defender captures this information, the intelligence gathered can be analyzed to gain insight into the activity of an adversary at a level deeper than normal system activity monitoring.\n### Opportunity\nThere is an opportunity for the defender to observe the adversary and control what they can see, what effects they can have, and/or what data they can access.\n### Use Case\nA defender can monitor and analyze operating system functions calls for detection and alerting.\n### Procedures\nTrace activity through WinSock TCP API functions to view potentially  malicious network events. Log it such that it can be pushed to a centralized location and analyzed further.\nHook the Win32 DeleteFile() function to log all attempts at deleting a given file. This information can be used to trigger restoration attempts on critical data, reducing potential disruption if those files are unavailable for prolonged periods of time."
