    "# T1200 - Hardware Additions",
    "\n",
    "Adversaries may introduce computer accessories, networking hardware, or other computing devices into a system or network that can be used as a vector to gain access. Rather than just connecting and distributing payloads via removable storage (i.e. [Replication Through Removable Media](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1091)), more robust hardware additions can be used to introduce new functionalities and/or features into a system that can then be abused.\n\nWhile public references of usage by threat actors are scarce, many red teams/penetration testers leverage hardware additions for initial access. Commercial and open source products can be leveraged with capabilities such as passive network tapping, network traffic modification (i.e. [Adversary-in-the-Middle](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1557)), keystroke injection, kernel memory reading via DMA, addition of new wireless access to an existing network, and others.(Citation: Ossmann Star Feb 2011)(Citation: Aleks Weapons Nov 2015)(Citation: Frisk DMA August 2016)(Citation: McMillan Pwn March 2012)"

    "## Shield Active Defense\n### Isolation \n Configure devices, systems, networks, etc. to contain activity and data in order to promote inspection or prevent expanding an engagement beyond desired limits. \n\n Using isolation, a defender can prevent potentially malicious activity before it starts or limit its effectiveness and scope. A defender can observe behaviors of adversaries or their tools without exposing them to unintended targets.\n#### Opportunity\nThere is an opportunity to test hardware additions in an isolated environment and ensure they can't be used by an adversary.\n#### Use Case\nA defender can install any suspect hardware on an isolated system and monitor for non-standard behaviors.\n#### Procedures\nUnplug an infected system from the network and disable any other means of communication.\nRun all user applications in isolated containers to prevent a compromise from expanding beyond the container's boundaries."
