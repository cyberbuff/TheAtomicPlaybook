    "Adversaries may send phishing messages to gain access to victim systems. All forms of phishing are electronically delivered social engineering. Phishing can be targeted, known as spearphishing. In spearphishing, a specific individual, company, or industry will be targeted by the adversary. More generally, adversaries can conduct non-targeted phishing, such as in mass malware spam campaigns.\n\nAdversaries may send victims emails containing malicious attachments or links, typically to execute malicious code on victim systems. Phishing may also be conducted via third-party services, like social media platforms. Phishing may also involve social engineering techniques, such as posing as a trusted source."

    "## Detection",
    "\n",
    "Network intrusion detection systems and email gateways can be used to detect phishing with malicious attachments in transit. Detonation chambers may also be used to identify malicious attachments. Solutions can be signature and behavior based, but adversaries may construct attachments in a way to avoid these systems.\n\nFiltering based on DKIM+SPF or header analysis can help detect when the email sender is spoofed.(Citation: Microsoft Anti Spoofing)(Citation: ACSC Email Spoofing)\n\nURL inspection within email (including expanding shortened links) can help detect links leading to known malicious sites. Detonation chambers can be used to detect these links and either automatically go to these sites to determine if they're potentially malicious, or wait and capture the content if a user visits the link.\n\nBecause most common third-party services used for phishing via service leverage TLS encryption, SSL/TLS inspection is generally required to detect the initial communication/delivery. With SSL/TLS inspection intrusion detection signatures or other security gateway appliances may be able to detect malware.\n\nAnti-virus can potentially detect malicious documents and files that are downloaded on the user's computer. Many possible detections of follow-on behavior may take place once [User Execution](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1204) occurs."

    "## Shield Active Defense\n### Email Manipulation \n Modify the flow or contents of email.\n \n\n Email flow manipulation includes changing which mail appliances process mail flows, to which systems they forward mail, or moving mail after it arrives in an inbox.  Email content manipulation includes altering the contents of an email message.\n#### Opportunity\nA phishing email can be detected and blocked from arriving at the intended recipient.  \n#### Use Case\nA defender can intercept emails that are detected as suspicious or malicious by email detection tools and prevent deliver to the intended target. \n#### Procedures\nModify the destination of inbound email to facilitate the collection of inbound spearphishing messages.\nModify the contents of an email message to maintain continuity when it is used for adversary engagement purposes."
