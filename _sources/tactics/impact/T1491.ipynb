    "# Shield Active Defense\n## System Activity Monitoring \n Collect system activity logs which can reveal adversary activity. \n\n Capturing system logs can show logins, user and system events, etc.  Collecting this data and potentially sending it to a centralized location can help reveal the presence of an adversary and the actions they perform on a compromised system.\n### Opportunity\nThere is an opportunity to detect an adversary who modifies website content (internally or externally) by monitoring for unauthorized changes to websites.\n### Use Case\nA defender can monitor websites for unplanned content changes and generate alerts when activity is detected.\n### Procedures\nEnsure that systems capture and retain common system level activity artifacts that might be produced.\nMonitor Windows systems for event codes that reflect an adversary changing passwords, adding accounts to groups, etc."
