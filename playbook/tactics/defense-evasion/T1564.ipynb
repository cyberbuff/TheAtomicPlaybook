   "source": "# T1564 - Hide Artifacts\nAdversaries may attempt to hide artifacts associated with their behaviors to evade detection. Operating systems may have features to hide various artifacts, such as important system files and administrative task execution, to avoid disrupting user work environments and prevent users from changing files or features on the system. Adversaries may abuse these features to hide artifacts such as files, directories, user accounts, or other system activity to evade detection.(Citation: Sofacy Komplex Trojan)(Citation: Cybereason OSX Pirrit)(Citation: MalwareBytes ADS July 2015)\n\nAdversaries may also attempt to hide artifacts associated with malicious behavior by creating computing regions that are isolated from common security instrumentation, such as through the use of virtualization technology.(Citation: Sophos Ragnar May 2020)"

An example of this technique can be seen in sample\n\nf986040c7dd75b012e7dfd876acb33a158abf651033563ab068800f07f508226\n\nThis sample contains a document inside of itself. Document 1 is the actual maldoc itself, document 2\nis the same document without all the malicious code. Document 1 will copy Document 2 to the file system\nand then \"peek\" inside of this document and pull out the oleObject.bin file. Contained inside of this\noleObject.bin file is a payload that is parsed out and executed on the file system.\n\n**Supported Platforms:** windows\n#### Dependencies:  Run with `powershell`!\n##### Description: Microsoft Word must be installed\n\n##### Check Prereq Commands:\n```powershell\ntry {\n  New-Object -COMObject \"Word.Application\" | Out-Null\n  Stop-Process -Name \"winword\"\n  exit 0\n} catch { exit 1 }\n\n```\n##### Get Prereq Commands:\n```powershell\nWrite-Host \"You will need to install Microsoft Word manually to meet this requirement\"\n\n```"

This can increase the speed at which dynamic analysis can be performed when a normal malicious file sleeps for long periods before attempting additional capabilities.\nHook the Win32 NetUserChangePassword() and modify it such that the new password is different from the one provided. The data passed into the function is encrypted along with the modified new password, then logged so a defender can get alerted about the change as well as decrypt the new password for use.\nAlter the output of an adversary's profiling commands to make newly-built systems look like the operating system was installed months earlier.\nAlter the output of adversary recon commands to not show important assets, such as a file server containing sensitive data.\n"
