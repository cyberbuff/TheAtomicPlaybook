This not only involves impairing preventative defenses, such as firewalls and anti-virus, but also detection capabilities that defenders can use to audit activity and identify malicious behavior. This may also span both native defenses as well as supplemental capabilities installed by users and administrators.\n\nAdversaries could also target event aggregation and analysis mechanisms, or otherwise disrupt these procedures by altering other system components."

    "The following Atomic adds a registry entry to disable LSA Protection.\n\nThe LSA controls and manages user rights information, password hashes and other important bits of information in memory. Attacker tools, such as mimikatz, rely on accessing this content to scrape password hashes or clear-text passwords. Enabling LSA Protection configures Windows to control the information stored in memory in a more secure fashion - specifically, to prevent non-protected processes from accessing that data.\nUpon successful execution, the registry will be modified and RunAsPPL will be set to 0, disabling Lsass protection.\nhttps://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/security/credentials-protection-and-management/configuring-additional-lsa-protection#how-to-disable-lsa-protection\nhttps://blog.netwrix.com/2022/01/11/understanding-lsa-protection/\nhttps://thedfirreport.com/2022/03/21/phosphorus-automates-initial-access-using-proxyshell/  \n",

On a single target system, defenders can configure multiple different services or user software applications.  On a target network, defenders can present systems with a variety of operating systems, operating system versions, applications, and services.\n#### Opportunity\nThere is an opportunity to study the adversary and collect first-hand observations about them and their tools.\n#### Use Case\nA defender can plant AV or monitoring tools which are easy for an adversary to remove. If an adversary removes these, they may be enticed to act more openly believing they have removed monitoring from the system.\n#### Procedures\nUse a mix of vulnerable and nonvulnerable software on a system to allow you to see what exploits the adversary leverages in their attacks.\nInstall Anti-virus or other end-point detection tools on systems to see if an adversary takes note of them and if so, how they react.\n"
