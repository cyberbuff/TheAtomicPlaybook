    "# T1080 - Taint Shared Content",
    "\n",
    "\nAdversaries may deliver payloads to remote systems by adding content to shared storage locations, such as network drives or internal code repositories. Content stored on network drives or in other shared locations may be tainted by adding malicious programs, scripts, or exploit code to otherwise valid files. Once a user opens the shared tainted content, the malicious portion can be executed to run the adversary's code on a remote system. Adversaries may use tainted shared content to move laterally.\n\nA directory share pivot is a variation on this technique that uses several other techniques to propagate malware when users access a shared network directory. It uses [Shortcut Modification](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1547/009) of directory .LNK files that use [Masquerading](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1036) to look like the real directories, which are hidden through [Hidden Files and Directories](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1564/001). The malicious .LNK-based directories have an embedded command that executes the hidden malware file in the directory and then opens the real intended directory so that the user's expected action still occurs. When used with frequently used network directories, the technique may result in frequent reinfections and broad access to systems and potentially to new and higher privileged accounts. (Citation: Retwin Directory Share Pivot)\n\nAdversaries may also compromise shared network directories through binary infections by appending or prepending its code to the healthy binary on the shared network directory. The malware may modify the original entry point (OEP) of the healthy binary to ensure that it is executed before the legitimate code. The infection could continue to spread via the newly infected file when it is executed by a remote system. These infections may target both binary and non-binary formats that end with extensions including, but not limited to, .EXE, .DLL, .SCR, .BAT, and/or .VBS."

    "Processes that write or overwrite many files to a network shared directory may be suspicious. Monitor processes that are executed from removable media for malicious or abnormal activity such as network connections due to Command and Control and possible network Discovery techniques.\n\nFrequently scan shared network directories for malicious files, hidden files, .LNK files, and other file types that may not typical exist in directories used to share specific types of content."

    "## Shield Active Defense\n### Decoy Content  \n Seed content that can be used to lead an adversary in a specific direction, entice a behavior, etc. \n\n Decoy Content is the data used to tell a story to an adversary. This content can be legitimate or synthetic data which is used to reinforce or validate your defensive strategy. Examples of decoy content are files on a storage object, entries in the system registry, system shortcuts, etc.\n#### Opportunity\nThere is an opportunity to introduce decoy information, users, systems, etc. to influence an adversary's future actions.\n#### Use Case\nA defender could seed decoy network shares within an adversary engagement network to see if an adversary uses them for payload delivery or lateral movement.\n#### Procedures\nCreate directories and files with names and contents using key words that may be relevant to an adversary to see if they examine or exfiltrate the data.\nSeed a file system with content that is of no value to the company but reinforces the legitimacy of the system if viewed by an adversary."
