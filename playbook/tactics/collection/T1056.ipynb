   "source": "# T1056 - Input Capture\nAdversaries may use methods of capturing user input to obtain credentials or collect information. During normal system usage, users often provide credentials to various different locations, such as login pages/portals or system dialog boxes. Input capture mechanisms may be transparent to the user (e.g. [Credential API Hooking](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1056/004)) or rely on deceiving the user into providing input into what they believe to be a genuine service (e.g. [Web Portal Capture](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1056/003))."

Examples of decoy content are files on a storage object, entries in the system registry, system shortcuts, etc.\n#### Opportunity\nThere is an opportunity to feed content to an adversary to influence their behaviors, test their interest in specific topics, or add legitimacy to a system or environment.\n#### Use Case\nA defender can feed decoy data to an adversary that is using a key-logger or other tool, so as to shape the encounter.\n#### Procedures\nCreate directories and files with names and contents using key words that may be relevant to an adversary to see if they examine or exfiltrate the data.\nSeed a file system with content that is of no value to the company but reinforces the legitimacy of the system if viewed by an adversary.\n"
