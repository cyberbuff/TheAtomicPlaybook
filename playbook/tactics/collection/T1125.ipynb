    "# T1125 - Video Capture",
    "\n",
    "An adversary can leverage a computer's peripheral devices (e.g., integrated cameras or webcams) or applications (e.g., video call services) to capture video recordings for the purpose of gathering information. Images may also be captured from devices or applications, potentially in specified intervals, in lieu of video files.\n\nMalware or scripts may be used to interact with the devices through an available API provided by the operating system or an application to capture video or images. Video or image files may be written to disk and exfiltrated later. This technique differs from [Screen Capture](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1113) due to use of specific devices or applications for video recording rather than capturing the victim's screen.\n\nIn macOS, there are a few different malware samples that record the user's webcam such as FruitFly and Proton.

    "## Detection",
    "\n",
    "Detection of this technique may be difficult due to the various APIs that may be used. Telemetry data regarding API use may not be useful depending on how a system is normally used, but may provide context to other potentially malicious activity occurring on a system.\n\nBehavior that could indicate technique use include an unknown or unusual process accessing APIs associated with devices or software that interact with the video camera, recording devices, or recording software, and a process periodically writing files to disk that contain video or camera image data."

    "# Shield Active Defense\n### Decoy Content  \n Seed content that can be used to lead an adversary in a specific direction, entice a behavior, etc. \n\n Decoy Content is the data used to tell a story to an adversary. This content can be legitimate or synthetic data which is used to reinforce or validate your defensive strategy. Examples of decoy content are files on a storage object, entries in the system registry, system shortcuts, etc.\n#### Opportunity\nThere is an opportunity to feed content to an adversary to influence their behaviors, test their interest in specific topics, or add legitimacy to a system or environment.\n#### Use Case\nA defender can introduce video content designed to make the adversary believe that their capture efforts are working.\n#### Procedures\nCreate directories and files with names and contents using key words that may be relevant to an adversary to see if they examine or exfiltrate the data.\nSeed a file system with content that is of no value to the company but reinforces the legitimacy of the system if viewed by an adversary."
