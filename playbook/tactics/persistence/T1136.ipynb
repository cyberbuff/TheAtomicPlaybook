With a sufficient level of access, creating such accounts may be used to establish secondary credentialed access that do not require persistent remote access tools to be deployed on the system.\n\nAccounts may be created on the local system or within a domain or cloud tenant. In cloud environments, adversaries may create accounts that only have access to specific services, which can reduce the chance of detection."

These procedures are in place for all users to ensure they can accomplish their goal in the approved manner. If an adversary attempts to perform any tasks which do not conform to the SOP, that activity will be easier to identify, alert on, and respond to.\n#### Opportunity\nThere is an opportunity to create a detection with a moderately high probability of success.\n#### Use Case\nA defender can detect user accounts created outside the acceptable process.\n#### Procedures\nRequire approvals and waivers for users to make changes to their system which requires administrative access. Any changes not made through this process are suspect and immediately investigated as malicious activity.\nCreate a development library that all users must leverage in order to interact with any hosted databases. This library modifies queries to look difficult to write. Any queries made without the library will now be obvious to detect and are immediately investigated as malicious activity.\n"
