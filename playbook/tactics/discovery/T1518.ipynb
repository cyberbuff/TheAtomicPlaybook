On a single target system, defenders can configure multiple different services or user software applications.  On a target network, defenders can present systems with a variety of operating systems, operating system versions, applications, and services.\n#### Opportunity\nThere is an opportunity to provide a variety of applications to an adversary to see what things an adversary prefers or to influence their operations.\n#### Use Case\nA defender can install an array of various software packages on a system to make it look used and populated. This will give an adversary a collection of software to interact with and possibly expose additional techniques.\n#### Procedures\nUse a mix of vulnerable and nonvulnerable software on a system to allow you to see what exploits the adversary leverages in their attacks.\nInstall Anti-virus or other end-point detection tools on systems to see if an adversary takes note of them and if so, how they react.\n"
