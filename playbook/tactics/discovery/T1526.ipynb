   "source": "# T1526 - Cloud Service Discovery\nAn adversary may attempt to enumerate the cloud services running on a system after gaining access. These methods can differ from platform-as-a-service (PaaS), to infrastructure-as-a-service (IaaS), or software-as-a-service (SaaS). Many services exist throughout the various cloud providers and can include Continuous Integration and Continuous Delivery (CI/CD), Lambda Functions, Azure AD, etc. They may also include security services, such as AWS GuardDuty and Microsoft Defender for Cloud, and logging services, such as AWS CloudTrail and Google Cloud Audit Logs.\n\nAdversaries may attempt to discover information about the services enabled throughout the environment. Azure tools and APIs, such as the Azure AD Graph API and Azure Resource Manager API, can enumerate resources and services, including applications, management groups, resources and policy definitions, and their relationships that are accessible by an identity.(Citation: Azure - Resource Manager API)(Citation: Azure AD Graph API)\n\nFor example, Stormspotter is an open source tool for enumerating and constructing a graph for Azure resources and services, and Pacu is an open source AWS exploitation framework that supports several methods for discovering cloud services.(Citation: Azure - Stormspotter)(Citation: GitHub Pacu)\n\nAdversaries may use the information gained to shape follow-on behaviors, such as targeting data or credentials from enumerated services or evading identified defenses through [Disable or Modify Tools](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1562/001) or [Disable or Modify Cloud Logs](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1562/008)."

A decoy network can be used to safely perform dynamic analysis of suspected malicious code. A defender can also use a specially crafted decoy network to perform adversary engagement. \n#### Opportunity\nThere is an opportunity to introduce services in a decoy network to determine if an adversary notices and tries to learn more about them.\n#### Use Case\nA defender can use a decoy network and seed it with cloud services to see how an adversary might exploit those resources.\n#### Procedures\nCreate an isolated network populated with decoy systems that can be used to study an adversary's tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs).\nUse a segregated network to visit a compromised site.  If the machine becomes infected, allow the machine to remain on with internet access to see if an adversary engages and takes action on the system.\n"
