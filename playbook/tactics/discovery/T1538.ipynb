   "source": "# T1538 - Cloud Service Dashboard\nAn adversary may use a cloud service dashboard GUI with stolen credentials to gain useful information from an operational cloud environment, such as specific services, resources, and features. For example, the GCP Command Center can be used to view all assets, findings of potential security risks, and to run additional queries, such as finding public IP addresses and open ports.(Citation: Google Command Center Dashboard)\n\nDepending on the configuration of the environment, an adversary may be able to enumerate more information via the graphical dashboard than an API. This allows the adversary to gain information without making any API requests."

Decoy credentials can be planted in many locations and leveraged in a variety of ways.\n#### Opportunity\nIn order to prolong an adversary engagement operation or enable detections, there is an opportunity to introduce credentials to an adversary that you want them to collect and use.\n#### Use Case\nA defender can plant decoy credentials across an array of locations to increase the chances of an adversary finding and using them.\n#### Procedures\nCreate user credentials for a decoy account, such as 'User ABC'.  Store those credentials in the browser and other places on the system to see if an adversary attempts to harvest them.\n"
