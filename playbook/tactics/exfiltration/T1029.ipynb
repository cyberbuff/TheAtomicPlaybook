This could be done to blend traffic patterns with normal activity or availability.\n\nWhen scheduled exfiltration is used, other exfiltration techniques likely apply as well to transfer the information out of the network, such as [Exfiltration Over C2 Channel](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1041) or [Exfiltration Over Alternative Protocol](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1048)."

A defender can then review them or send them to a centralized collection location for further analysis.\n#### Opportunity\nThere is an opportunity to monitor network traffic for different protocols, anomalous traffic patterns, transfer of data, etc. to determine the presence of an adversary.\n#### Use Case\nThe defender can implement network monitoring for and alert on  anomalous traffic patterns, large  or unexpected data transfers, and other activity that may reveal the presence of an adversary.\n#### Procedures\nCapture network logs for internet-facing devices and send those logs to a central collection location.\nCapture all network  device (router, switches, proxy, etc.) logs on a decoy network and send those logs to a central collection location.\n"
