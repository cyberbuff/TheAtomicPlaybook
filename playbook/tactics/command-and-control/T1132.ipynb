Command and control (C2) information can be encoded using a standard data encoding system. Use of data encoding may adhere to existing protocol specifications and includes use of ASCII, Unicode, Base64, MIME, or other binary-to-text and character encoding systems.(Citation: Wikipedia Binary-to-text Encoding) (Citation: Wikipedia Character Encoding) Some data encoding systems may also result in data compression, such as gzip."

Processes utilizing the network that do not normally have network communication or have never been seen before are suspicious. Analyze packet contents to detect communications that do not follow the expected protocol behavior for the port that is being used. (Citation: University of Birmingham C2)"

These tools are often required to process complex encryption ciphers and custom protocols into a human-readable format for an analyst to interpret.\n#### Opportunity\nThere is an opportunity to reveal data that the adversary has tried to protect from defenders\n#### Use Case\nDefenders can develop protocol decoders that can decrypt network capture data and expose an adversary's command and control traffic as well as their exfiltration activity.\n\n#### Procedures\nCreate and apply a decoder which allows you to view encrypted and/or encoded network traffic in a human-readable format.\n"
