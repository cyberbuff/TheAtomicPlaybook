# Welcome to the Atomic Playbook

The Atomic Playbook contains TTPs from the MITRE ATT&CK framework mapped to the tests in the Atomic Red Team. It serves as a single resource to know about the tests, it's execution, detection and defense techniques from [MITRE Shield](https://shield.mitre.org).

Note: Shield mapping to subtechniques is yet to be done.

The Atomic Playbook uses
- [Atomic Red Team](https://github.com/redcanaryco/atomic-red-team)
- [ATT&CK-Python-Client](https://github.com/hunters-forge/ATTACK-Python-Client)
- Jupyter Notebook
- Dotnet Interactive(To support Powershell in Jupyter)
- [MITRE Shield](https://shield.mitre.org)
